            <p>
                We are delighted to announce a special program at Ashram!
            </p>
            <p>
                After a gap of three years, Sadhguru will be conducting <strong>"In the Lap of the Master" –
                a Special Sathsang at the Isha Yoga Centre - Coimbatore, on 17th and 18th July 2016.</strong>
                This is a precious opportunity for you to spend two eventful days at Ashram in the presence of Sadhguru.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last time "In the Lap of the Master" was held, Sadhguru guided all the participants through powerful
                meditations and processes. For many, it was an unforgettable experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can catch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJq5cS5MU08">few glimpses</a> of a similar
                event held in 2009, when over 2,000 participants gathered at the Isha Yoga Center to be in the grace of
                Sadhguru. It was unprecedented. Those who embraced the opportunity were given special practices
                during the day and participated in sathsangs with the Master in the evening.
            </p>
            <p>
                In fact, it was during those two exhilarating days that Sounds of Isha premiered the songs that now make up the mesmerizing
                "In the Lap of the Master" Album. To listen to the songs, please
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj_grgnDdkU&amp;list=PL8q5PXY6JX3XurSC9Ze4BLLBBorpmd3AY">click here</a>.
            </p>
