                    Bhava Spandana is like making a person jump and look beyond the wall.
                    He sees beyond his limitation experientially.
                    Once he sees that, he knows that he must go over the wall one day to see what is on the other side.

            <p>
                We are excited to announce that Bhava Spandana program will be offered in Singapore/Malaysia in Sep 2016!
            </p>
            <p>
                Bhava Spandana Program (BSP) is a 4-day, 3-night residential program offered to those who have been initiated
                into Shambhavi Mahamudra. This advanced meditation program is designed by Sadhguru to provide the opportunity
                to go beyond the limitations of body and mind and experience higher levels of consciousness. BSP offers the
                experience of a world of unbounded love and joy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through powerful processes and meditations, the Bhava Spandana Program creates an intensely energetic situation,
                where individuality and the limitations of the five sense organs can be transcended, creating an experience of
                oneness and resonance with the rest of existence.

                    "BSP felt like a strange time-warp where all four days congealed to form one giant moment.
                    It felt like I was there alone yet I could see the other 90+ participants there with me.
                    I was talking, laughing, playing, crying with them but it still felt like I was there by myself and
                    all these participants were merely a figment of my imagination. You could say it felt like we were
                    all one big body of varying experiences. I cannot remember anything specific but something must have
                    happened because my life thereafter has never been the same; I began to see things differently.
                    I look at a tree these days and no longer see it as just a tree. I see it as a throbbing mass of life.
                    If I sit close to it, it feels like I can feel the activity that goes on within and around this towering
                    leafy giant. I look at people and see the goodness that resides in everyone." - Jean
