                <small>by a trained teacher</small></p>
            <br>

            <p>
                We are happy to announce that, after 5 years Isha Singapore is re-introducing the
                live Inner Engineering program designed by Sadhguru and conducted by a trained teacher.
                Previously offered as a 7-day course, it is now offered as a 4-day weekend programme with brand
                new content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inner Engineering is a comprehensive system, derived from the ancient science of yoga,
                to establish a deep and lasting personal transformation. It is a method of aligning your body,
                mind, emotions and energies to function at their peak and in complete harmony.
            </p>
            <p>
                The program includes Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya - a powerful 21-minute inner energy process
                that incorporates the breath; when practiced regularly, this 21-minute kriya can bring
                the following various benefits into one's life.

        <p>
            Many of you have expressed a desire in the past to go through Inner Engineering Online program again.
            After 5 years, this opportunity has become available again for all of us to go through Live Inner Engineering program.
            This is an ideal opportunity for us to listen to Sadhguru again as a volunteer and imbibe the tools of Inner Engineering
            to a much deeper and experiential level.
        </p>
