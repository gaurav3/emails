                We are happy to announce that, as a part of International Day of Yoga, we will be offering a series of
                Hatha Yoga programs in Singapore!
            </p>
            <p>
                Isha Hatha Yoga programs are an unparalleled opportunity to learn practices derived from a yogic tradition
                maintained in its full purity and vibrancy for thousands of years. The classes will be conducted by
                highly trained teachers and will offer classical Hatha Yoga in its full depth and dimension.
            </p>
            <p>
                They are not taught merely for physical fitness and strength. They are a holistic process of naturally
                achieving a certain mastery over the body and mind, so as to come to a state of health, joy, and bliss.
                They are ideal for the hectic pace of today's world.

        <p>
            Many of you have expressed a desire in the past to go through Inner Engineering Online program again.
            After 5 years, this opportunity has become available again for all of us to go through Live Inner Engineering program.
            This is an ideal opportunity for us to listen to Sadhguru again as a volunteer and imbibe the tools of Inner Engineering
            to a much deeper and experiential level.
        </p>
